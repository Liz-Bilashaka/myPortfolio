# My Portfolio

My portfolio using html css and javascript.

This project aim to show case the skills that i have learned in HTML5 and CSS3. I will also use some minor Javascript code to complete thsi website. This website will providers users with more information about myself as an upcoming developer such as a description about myslef, contact information and also a section that underlines my future work.

It will be easy for users to navigate and will also be interactive.

# Modules to use

# Deployment
This website was created using visual studio which us an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' 
to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
